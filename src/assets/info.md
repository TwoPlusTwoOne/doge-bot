:doge-cool: _Hey there_ :doge-cool:
Doge Bot is a bot used for counting how many :doge:s each person in a channel has sent
Why? Because _*Trust is our #1 value*_
And if you leave your computer unattended, then there is much doge :doge3d:

There are two counters - a temporary one and a total one. The temporary one resets at the end of the week. Counters are unique per channel.
