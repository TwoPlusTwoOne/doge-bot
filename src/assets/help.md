:doge_cool: Hey there :doge_cool:
Doge Bot is a bot used for counting how many :doge: each person in a channel has sent
Why? Because *Trust is our #1 value*
And if you leave your computer unattended, then there is much doge :doge3d:

There are two counters - a temporary one and a total one. The temporary one resets at 5 (think of a punishment like bringing a cake or wearing an embarassing shirt for a day). Counters are unique per channel

*Very help*
- get doges | list doges -> Get doge count list for this channel
- doge help -> Show this message

:doge_gif: Much message, so list :doge_gif:
